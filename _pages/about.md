I am a third-year PhD student working in the Geoinformatics lab at KTH Royal Institute of Technology under the supervision of Yifang Ban.

My research focuses on the application of deep learning methods to Earth observation data for urban applications. I am particularly interested in data fusion, semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation.
