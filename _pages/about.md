I am a third-year PhD student working in the Geoinformatics division at KTH Royal Institute of Technology under the supervision of Yifang Ban.

My research focuses on the application of deep learning methods to Earth observation data for urban applications, including urban mapping and change detection. I am particularly interested in semi-supervised learning, SAR-optical data fusion and domain adaptation.
